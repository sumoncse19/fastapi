  - `POST /auth/register` - User registration
  - `POST /auth/token` - User login (OAuth2 form)
  - `GET /auth/me` - Get current user profile
  - `PUT /auth/profile` - Update user profile

- **Meal Endpoints**
  - `POST /meals/analyze-photo` - Upload and analyze meal photos
  - `GET /meals/` - Get user's meals (with date filtering)
  - `GET /meals/daily-summary/{date}` - Get daily calorie summary
  - `PUT /meals/{meal_id}` - Update meal details
  - `DELETE /meals/{meal_id}` - Delete meal

## Configuration
